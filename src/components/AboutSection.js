            Shikha Jaiswal has been passionate about make-up and cosmetics ever
            since she was a little girl. She would carefully observe her mother
            apply make-up, and would emphasize on the importance of applying
            high quality products. Her love for children led to her working as a
            full-time ECCE tutor.

            She also tried her hand at jewellery designing and was in the
            industry for a short stint. As one is destined to pursue the things
            they love, she decided to turn her passion and love for make-up into
            a full-time professional job.

            She was the go-to make-up artist amongst her peers, providing her
            skills for formals and weddings. She enrolled for a Diploma course
            from a leading academy in Mumbai, where she learnt the essentials of
            make-up/hair and styling. Shikha found that the communications and
            business skills acquired in her prior professional stint would carry
            over when developing her own freelance make-up business, and allowed
            her to build her network in Mumbai and beyond. Along with providing
            make-up services she also conducts workshops and short courses for
            all age groups.
