    review: `Shikha understood my requirement and did exactly what I wanted. She is very neat and works in a 
    very systematic manner. Her charges was worth the effort she put in. I got a lot of
    compliments as she blended the makeup very well and it went great with my outfit. I surely will recommend Shikha
    and will hire her myself again and again.`,

      experienced and well-known artists from the industry. She was on time even though I had a
      last-minute booking. I thank Urban Clap for giving me such a terrific artist. I would definitely
      recommend her to all. Superb job.`,
